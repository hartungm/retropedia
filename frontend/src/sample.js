An E, S, V or P will do. Ask them to fold the papers. As the facilitator, mark the score on the flip chart. Make sure you put the sticky notes back in your pocket, keep it anonymous and throw them away afterwards.\n\nDiscuss the results, in case you got all prisoners; I would advise you to improvise and talk about why they feel like a prisoner.",
